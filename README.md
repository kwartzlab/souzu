ðŸŽ‹ Souzu
=======

A simple service to monitor Bambu printers on the local network and deliver print status notifications to a Slack channel.

On start, Souzu listens for Bambu printer advertisements on the local network. For each printer, if it has a corresponding access code in its config file, it tries to monitor the MQTT stream from the printer.

Souzu never sends any commands to the printer, not even to poll for full status reports. This means that the load on the printer should be minimal.

## Configuration

Put a configuration file in `~/.config/souzu.json`:

```json
{
  "printers": {
    "PRINTER_SERIAL_NUMBER": {
      "access_code": "ACCESS_CODE",
      "filename_prefix": "prefix for log file names (optional)"
    },
    "OTHER_PRINTER_SERIAL_NUMBER": {
      "access_code": "ACCESS_CODE",
      "ip_address": "hardcoded ip address (optional)"
    }
  },
  "slack": {
    "access_token": "SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "print_notification_channel": "SOME_CHANNEL_ID",
    "error_notification_channel": "SOME_CHANNEL_ID"
  }
}
```
