ðŸŽ‹ Souzu
=======

A simple service to monitor Bambu printers on the local network and deliver print status notifications to a Slack channel.

On start, Souzu listens for Bambu printer advertisements on the local network. For each printer, if it has a corresponding access code in its config file, it tries to monitor the MQTT stream from the printer.

Souzu never sends any commands to the printer, not even to poll for full status reports. This means that the load on the printer should be minimal.

## Configuration

Put a configuration file in `~/.config/souzu.json`:

```json
{
  "printers": {
    "PRINTER_SERIAL_NUMBER": {
      "access_code": "ACCESS_CODE",
      "filename_prefix": "prefix for log file names (optional)"
    },
    "OTHER_PRINTER_SERIAL_NUMBER": {
      "access_code": "ACCESS_CODE",
      "ip_address": "hardcoded ip address (optional)"
    }
  },
  "slack": {
    "access_token": "SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "print_notification_channel": "SOME_CHANNEL_ID",
    "error_notification_channel": "SOME_CHANNEL_ID"
  }
}
```

## Installation

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

To install from GitHub:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/kwartzlab/souzu
```

Then run `souzu monitor` to start the service.

A simple self-updater is included, so if you installed this tool using `uv`, you can run `souzu update` to update to the latest version.

## Developing

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

To install git pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting:

```sh
./install-hooks.sh
```

To run from the source tree:

```sh
uv run souzu
```

To build and install locally:

```sh
./build.sh -i
```

To build and push to a remote host over SSH, assuming the remote host also has `uv` installed:

```sh
./build.sh -p host
```
